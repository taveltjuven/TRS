Using a while-loop to iterate through the current day in a closed date interval while checking if the day is a weekday or a weekend. The day of the week number is given by Zeller's algorithm (from Wikipedia). A dictionary is generated to keep track of the number of days in each month, including leap years.

Unit testing with pandas.

I was expecting the while loop to be faster (nested for-loop might be a faster implementation).
