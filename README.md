Using a while loop to iterate thourgh the current day in a closed date intercal
The day of the week number is given by Zellers algo (from wikipedia)
Generated a dict to keep track of days in month, including paying attention to leap year

Unit testing with pandas

I was expecting the while loop to be faster, a nest for loop might be a faster implementation.
