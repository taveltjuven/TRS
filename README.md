Using a while loop to iterate through the current day in a closed date interval. The day of the week number is given by Zeller's algorithm (from Wikipedia). A dictionary is generated to keep track of the number of days in each month, including leap years.

Unit testing with pandas.

I was expecting the while loop to be faster, but a nested for loop might be a faster implementation
